## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
**Agile:**
Advantages:
Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and customer needs.
Regular feedback loops reduce the risk of project failure.
Continuous delivery of product increments allows for early detection and correction of issues.
Disadvantages:
Requires significant customer involvement, which may not always be feasible.
Less predictability in terms of time and cost, making it harder to manage scope and deadlines.
Can be challenging for large teams or projects with strict regulatory requirements.
**Waterfall:**
Advantages:
Clear structure and milestones make it easy to manage and document progress.
Well-suited for projects with well-defined requirements and scope.
Easier to manage large teams where roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.
Disadvantages:
Inflexible to changes, making it less suitable for projects where requirements may evolve.
Higher risk of project failure if issues are not identified until the testing phase.
Limited customer involvement, which can result in a final product that doesn’t meet customer expectations.
